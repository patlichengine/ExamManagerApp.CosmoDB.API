# Task Project
## Introduction
This project connecto to a local Cosmos DB running on the emulator. It can also be switched to work with Production, provided the necessary configuration is carried out.

## In this project, I created some CRUD API endpoints for carrying out different functions.

   - For managing question in their respective structures.
   - Sending an application by a candidate
   - There is also a Unit Test project that tested only feew endpoints

### The PDF file included in the root of the repo provides screenshots of the performance of the endpoints
## Thank you
